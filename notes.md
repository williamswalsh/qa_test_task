# Tasks:

Create repo on Github - DONE

# Front end testing:

Create a test strategy for this e-commerce application https://www.saucedemo.com/
Some features that could be covered are:
Log in, log in, search for products, filtering, product listing page, product details page, cart, checkout
Create the test plan for the feature under test
Choose a framework from your preference and explain why
We use Python as the programming language
Create the automation project from scratch covering the most important scenarios
Report bugs with severity and priorities
Add the instructions to install and how to run the tests

**_NB_** Add the tests in a Continuous Integration tool and Docker.
Likely to be in top of class if do this!

# Backend testing:

REST API automated tests - target: https://petstore.swagger.io/
The idea of this exercise is to implement automated tests for an API
creating data, modifying existing data, or deleting data.
test cases for HTTP status codes, sending proper information, invalid information, incorrect format, and other possible edge cases;
Choose a framework from your preference (you can use the same one from the previous exercise)
Report bugs with severity and priorities
Add the instructions to install and how to run the tests (you can use the same one from the previous exercise)
